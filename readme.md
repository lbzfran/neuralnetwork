# Intro

My attempt at writing a functionable Neural Network in C.

The core functionality is outlined as follows:
- [ ] Feed-Forwarding
- [ ] Backward Propagation (with Gradient Descent)
- [ ] Dynamic Input and Layer Count
- [ ] Simple to use

# Build

The main build script requires a POSIX shell to run.

```sh
./build.sh
```

Alternatively, there is a build script available for Powershell (for Windows-based systems).

```pwsh
.\build.ps1
```

The result will create a shared library inside the `./build/` directory,
along with the available test cases found in the `./tests/` directory.

# Usage

Will be updated when the final update is released.
